I am an Assistant Professor at the [Systems Group](https://systems.ethz.ch) at the department of Computer Science of ETH Zurich. My research interests are broad and include systems, concurrent computing, programming languages and sustainable computing. My research focuses on designing system fundamentals, across software and hardware, to improve the performance and efficiency while guaranteeing correctness of next-generation computing platforms and emerging technologies.


Prior to that, I did my postdoc at the Systems Group at ETH, working with [Prof. Gustavo Alonso](https://systems.ethz.ch/people/profile.gustavo-alonso.html). I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Technion, advised by [Prof. Erez Petrank](https://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~erez/), and was generously supported by the Azrieli Foundation Fellowship. During my Ph.D I developed concurrent data structures for non-volatile memories. I completed my BSc summa cum laude at the Computer Science Department at the Technion.
