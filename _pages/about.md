I am a post-doc at the System Group of ETH, working with [Prof. Gustavo Alonso](https://systems.ethz.ch/people/profile.gustavo-alonso.html). My research interests are broad and include systems, concurrent computing and programming languages. I obtained a PhD in the department of Computer Science at the Technion, advised by [Prof. Erez Petrank](https://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~erez/). I completed my BSc summa cum laude at the Computer Science Department at the Technion. Between 2014-2015, I worked at Elbit Systems in Yokneam, developing tools and infrastructure for main projects in the company. Between August-October of 2017, I interned at Google New-York, researching garbage collection for flash memory devices.
